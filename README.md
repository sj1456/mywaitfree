This is my first Django web app.

Mywaitfree is an app to help restaurant to manage the waiting line. 
 - Here is the website, which is running on an EC2 instance: http://ec2-18-220-5-53.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/mywaitfree/
 - If there is no table available, the guests can type in their info, which will be saved into backend database. 
 - The current waiting list can also be displayed.
